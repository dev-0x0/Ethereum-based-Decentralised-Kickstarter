Decentralised version of Kickstarter built on the Ethereum blockchain
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- The smart contracts were written with Solidity, and the front-end of the applica-
tion was created using Web3 and React. The project was deployed to the Rinkeby
Ethereum test network, where users interact with it using the Metamask browser
extension.

- The goal of the project was to reduce the risk of losing money on fraudulent projects,
or projects that fail to deliver on a promised outcome. This is achieved by giving
contributors more input and control over how funds are managed.

- Rather than have total control over all funds provided by project contributors, the
creator of the project must submit requests specifying an amount of money, and
exact details of what it will be spent on.

- A majority of contributors must then approve a request in order for the requested
amount to be released to the creator.
